# UAC Bypass Educational Project  

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is my first project, and I‚Äôm excited to share it with the world. This code is designed strictly for **learning purposes and ethical use**. It demonstrates how Windows processes can be leveraged to achieve a User Account Control (UAC) bypass using built-in tools.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This code is intended for educational and ethical purposes only. Any misuse of this project is strictly discouraged and could lead to legal consequences. Always use such tools responsibly and with appropriate permissions.

## üöÄ How It Works  

This project utilizes Windows' own processes and registry settings to achieve elevated privileges without directly interacting with sensitive system files. Here‚Äôs the concept in a nutshell:  

1. It modifies registry keys that control how Windows starts certain programs.  
2. When `explorer.exe` launches, it triggers `fodhelper.exe` (a trusted Windows executable) to execute the specified commands or payload.  
3. This bypasses UAC prompts, as the execution appears to be initiated by a trusted system process.  

The key advantage of this approach is that the exploit uses legitimate Windows tools, minimizing direct interaction with the system.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use  

Follow these steps to test and learn from this code:  

1. **Unzip the Project:** Extract all files from the provided zip archive and place them in the same folder.  
2. **Modify the Payload:** Update the `data` variable in the code to define your desired command or file that should run when `fodhelper.exe` is triggered.  
3. **Compile the Code:** Use a C compiler to compile `uac_bypass.c` into an executable file. For example, you can use MinGW or Visual Studio to compile:  
   ```bash
   gcc uac_bypass.c -o uac_bypass.exe
   ```  
4. **Execute the Code:** Run the compiled executable. It will attempt to write to the registry and leverage the exploit to execute the defined payload with elevated privileges.

## üîç Evading Detection  

To minimize traces and enhance stealth:  
- Ensure the payload deletes the registry keys after execution to prevent detection.  
- Clear any related events and logs that might reveal the exploit attempt.  

---

## ‚ö° Key Features  

- Leverages trusted Windows binaries (`fodhelper.exe`) for execution.  
- Demonstrates a practical example of UAC bypass techniques.  
- Aims to educate ethical hackers, penetration testers, and security enthusiasts about Windows security mechanisms.

## ‚ùó Important Notes  

This project is for **educational purposes only**. Using it maliciously is unethical and potentially illegal. Always seek permission before testing such techniques on any system.  

If you‚Äôre learning about cybersecurity, this project can serve as a foundation for understanding privilege escalation techniques and securing systems against such vulnerabilities.
